# LaJase's dotfiles

Warning : Donâ€™t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails
To manage it, I use yadm since I'm a lazy boy and because other soultions soen't sems to fit my needs

# Installation

In order to isntall all the dotfiles, run command
```bash
yadm clone git@github.com:LaJase/dotfiles.git --bootstrap
```

`--bootsrtap` argument implies the run of Installation script, those installed package are not
handled on git but are necessary to fully appreciate the environment I want to create for my daily
work. Nothing is perfect here and I love spending some night to see what can be enhanced here.

# What's installed
